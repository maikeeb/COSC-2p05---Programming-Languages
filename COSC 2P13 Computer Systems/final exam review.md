# Final exam review
## Computer systems cosc 2p13


## Introduction

+ Top level Components
> CPU connected to the main memory and I/O module using the system bus. The cpu does all the calculations, the main memory holds the data from the current processes and the I/O module is used to get more information which the main memory doesnt have access to ie. secondary memory, user input (keyboard mouse)

+ Memory Hierarchy
>Faster access time, greater cost per bit
>Greater capacity, smaller cost per bit
>Greater capacity, slower access speed

+ Interrupts
> Interrupt the normal sequencing of the processor
> Most I/O devices are slower than the processor
> Processor must pause to wait for device
  - Classes of interrupts
    + **Program:** Generated by some condition that occurs as a result of an instruction execution, such as arithmetic overflow, division by zero, attempt to execute an illegal machine instruction, and refernce outside a user's allowed memory space
    + **Timer:** Generated by a timer within the processor. This allows the operating system to perform certain functions on a regular basis.
    + **I/O:** Generated by an I/O controller, to signal normal completion of an operation or to signal a variety of error conditions.
    + **Hardware failure:** Generated by a failure, such as power failure or memory parity error.
  - Interupt handler
>Program to service a particular I/O device
>Generally part of the operating system

+ Uniprogramming
> Processor must wait for I/O instructions to complete before preceding
![Alt text](chrome_RfHR2yI1K1.png)
+ Multiprogramming
> When one jobes needs to wait for I/O
> + The processor can switch to another other job
![Alt text](chrome_mtZW3WL3Cs.png)
+ Time sharing
> + Using multiprogramming to handle mutliple interactive jobs
> + Processor's time is shared among multiple users
> + Multiple users simultaneously access the system through terminals
> + **Time Slicing** 
>   - Regular time intervals
>   - Preemption -> switch jobs(users)

+ Address space
> + Space in the main memory to hold a program/process
> + Processes address up to 64 bits spaces in main memory 
>   - Processes requiring more than that
>     + Virtual memory

+ System Calls
> + Programmtice method to request a service from the kernel

## Process and Threads

#### Process
+ PCB
> Stands for **P**rocess **C**ontrol **B**lock
> + Contains the process elements
> + Created and manage by operating sysem
> + Allows support for multiple process
![Alt text](chrome_LpVyC0NnSm.png)
+ Seven-state process model
>![Alt text](chrome_LmOeUXPGZW.png)
> **supsended** allows the cpu to take out processes out of main memory as it waiting for the I/O to respond with the need information to finish the process
> **Blocked** is where process go when an event/interrupt occurs which doesnt always need to be taken out of the memory as the event might not last long
> **Ready/Running** all programs that are being run is being cycled through ready and running for the cpu to work a little bit then alternate between the processes to make it seem like its doing multiple things simulatinously
+ Time sharing
>

#### Thread
+ Definition
> light-weight process

+ Benefits
> + resource ownership
>   - process includes a virtual adress space to hold the process image
> + scheduling/execution
>   - Follows an execution path that may be interleaved with other processes

+ Multithread process model
> Operating system supports multiple threads of execution within a single process

+ Types of threads:
  - user-level
  >
  - kernel-level
  >
  - combined
  >

+ Race conditions:
>

+ Critical Regions:
>

+ Mutual Exclusions:
>

+ Busy Waiting:
>

+ Sleep and wakeup
>

+ semaphore
>

+ Mutex
