# Final exam review
## Computer systems cosc 2p13


## Introduction

+ Top level Components
> CPU connected to the main memory and I/O module using the system bus. The cpu does all the calculations, the main memory holds the data from the current processes and the I/O module is used to get more information which the main memory doesnt have access to ie. secondary memory, user input (keyboard mouse)

+ Memory Hierarchy
>Faster access time, greater cost per bit
>Greater capacity, smaller cost per bit
>Greater capacity, slower access speed

+ Interrupts
>

+ Uniprogramming
>

+ Multiprogramming
>

+ Time sharing
>

+ Address space
>

+ System Calls
>

## Process and Threads

#### Process
+ PCB
>

+ Seven-state process model
>

+ Time sharing
>

#### Thread
+ Definition
> light-weight process

+ Benefits
>

+ Multithread process model
>

+ Types of threads:
  - user-level
  >
  - kernel-level
  >
  - combined
  >

+ Race conditions:
>

+ Critical Regions:
>

+ Mutual Exclusions:
>

+ Busy Waiting:
>

+ Sleep and wakeup
>

+ semaphore
>

+ Mutex
