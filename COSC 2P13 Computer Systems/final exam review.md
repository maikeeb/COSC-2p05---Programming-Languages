# Final exam review
## Computer systems cosc 2p13


## Introduction

+ Top level Components
> CPU connected to the main memory and I/O module using the system bus. The cpu does all the calculations, the main memory holds the data from the current processes and the I/O module is used to get more information which the main memory doesnt have access to ie. secondary memory, user input (keyboard mouse)

+ Memory Hierarchy
>Faster access time, greater cost per bit
>Greater capacity, smaller cost per bit
>Greater capacity, slower access speed

+ Interrupts
> Interrupt the normal sequencing of the processor
> Most I/O devices are slower than the processor
> Processor must pause to wait for device
  - Classes of interrupts
    + **Program:** Generated by some condition that occurs as a result of an instruction execution, such as arithmetic overflow, division by zero, attempt to execute an illegal machine instruction, and refernce outside a user's allowed memory space
    + **Timer:** Generated by a timer within the processor. This allows the operating system to perform certain functions on a regular basis.
    + **I/O:** Generated by an I/O controller, to signal normal completion of an operation or to signal a variety of error conditions.
    + **Hardware failure:** Generated by a failure, such as power failure or memory parity error.
