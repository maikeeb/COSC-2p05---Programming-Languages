# Week 2 :Evolution of programming languages

## PL/I
- First language designed for a broad spectrum of use cases
- Developed by IBM in 1963

### PL/I uses the best part of 
> Includes Algol 60's 
   > > block structure
   > > and recursion

> Fortran IV's
>> separate compilation with communication through global data

> COBOL's
>>data structures, 
>>input/output, 
>>report generating facilities

+ Huge language with a lot of features; first in having
  - Creating concurrently executing subprograms
  - Exception handling (23 different exceptions)
